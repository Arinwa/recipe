## Build and Run a Recipe Management App with Node.js and MongoDB

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a recipe management application built with Node.js and MongoDB.

**What you'll learn:**

* Building a Node.js application
* Connecting to a MongoDB database
* Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on recipe data

**Requirements:**

* Node.js and npm installed on your system

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Begin by obtaining the application code. You can do this by cloning the repository using Git commands or your preferred version control tool.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application:**

   Once the dependencies are installed, start the application using:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to view the recipe management app.

**Additional Notes:**

* This application utilizes MongoDB as the database and leverages a REST API for CRUD operations on recipes.
* Feel free to explore the codebase within your code editor to understand the implementation details.
